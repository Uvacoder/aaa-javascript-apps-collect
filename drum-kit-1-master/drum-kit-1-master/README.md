# Drüm Kït

Wanting to refresh my vanilla JavaScript skills, I decided to do Wesbos 30 day Vanilla JS challenge. For day 1, a simple app was built where when a user presses on the letters on the screen that match the ones on their keyboard, a drum sound plays. Now users can simply practice the beat of the drums by simply tapping away!
